title: About SPLI
---

The Scottish Programming Languages Institute (SPLI) coordinates community events that enhance programming languages research in Scotland. It brings together researchers from the University of Edinburgh, the University of Glasgow, Heriot-Watt University, the University of St Andrews, the University of Stirling, the University of Strathclyde, and the University of the West of Scotland. Details about SPLI's structure are available on our [organisation](/organisation.html) page.

SPLI researchers cover a wide range of topics, from theoretical foundations and semantics to implementation, compilation, and optimisation. Students interested in pursuing a PhD can find potential supervisors on our [PhD Opportunities](/supervisors.html) page.

For information on our events, such as the Scottish Programming Languages Seminar series (SPLS) and the Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School (SPLV), visit our [events](/events.html) page.

We maintain a lively online community on Zulip, where many SPLI activities are coordinated. You can also follow us on [X](https://twitter.com/scottish_pli) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.scot/@spli).

We collaborate with the [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA)](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk), to promote and support activities, especially for PhD students.
