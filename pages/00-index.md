The Scottish Programming Languages Institute (SPLI) co-ordinates community events which enhance programming languages research in Scotland.

It unites researchers in programming languages from the University of Edinburgh, the University of Glasgow, Heriot-Watt University, the University of St. Andrews, the University of Stirling, the University of Strathclyde, and the University of the West of Scotland. 

Researchers within SPLI cover a broad range of topics under the Programming Languages umbrella, ranging from theoretical foundations, semantics and verification to implementation, compilation and optimisation. A full list of members as well as their general research area can be found on our [people](/01-people.html) page.

For information on the events we run, including the Scottish Programming Languages Seminar series (SPLS) and the Scottish Programming Languages and Verification Summer School (SPLV), please see our [events](/02-events.html) page. 

We also run a lively online community on our [Zulip](http://spls.zulipchat.com/) instance, where many SPLI activities and events are co-ordinated. 

We collaborate with the [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/) (SICSA), to promote and support activities, especially for PhD students.
